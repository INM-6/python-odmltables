Introduction
============
OdML files are a good way of storing your metadata. But, the more complex the structure of an odML is, the more difficult it gets to keep an overview of the data. This is a problem, especially when editing an odML file. In order to offer some help with this problem the following classes were created. They give you the possibility to transform data from an odML file to a table in csv or excel, which is not only easy readable but can also be edited and turned back to an odML file. In this documentation you will find a tutorial, explainig you the main steps for using this functions, but also a detailed documentation of the code itself.
