**************************************************************
odML-tables - Table-based editing of odML metadata collections
**************************************************************

Synopsis
=========

*odML-tables* is a tool to support working with metadata collections for electrophysiological data. It provides both a library interface as well as a graphical user interface to perform typical tasks that arise when dealing with metadata collections based on the odML_ format. Currently, odML-tables supports:

- converting odML files to table-based representations and back
- creating an empty odML template
- comparing sections within an odML file
- filtering odML files to subsets
- merging multiple odML files
